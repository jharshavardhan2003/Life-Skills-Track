# Focus Management – Deep Work & Productivity

## Question 1: What is Deep Work?

**Deep Work** is:

- The ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.
- Work that pushes your mental capacity to its limits.
- Work that creates new value, improves skill, and is hard to replicate.

Coined by **Cal Newport**, deep work is contrasted with shallow work (emails, social media, multitasking).

## Intentionally Creating Diffused Mode

**Diffused mode** is when your brain is at rest, allowing it to process information passively and creatively.

### Activities that support this:

- Meditation
- Walking without a phone
- Standing or sitting in silence
- Lying down in silence or doing Shavasana
- Doing physical chores with full attention

## Getting Started on Difficult Tasks

**Reason for procrastination:** avoidance of emotions like fear, boredom, or frustration.

### Method to overcome:

1. Work on the task for just 30 seconds.
2. Take a short break.
3. Remind yourself: "I can handle this."

Repeat steps and slowly increase the work duration. This helps build evidence of your capability and forms a new self-identity.
