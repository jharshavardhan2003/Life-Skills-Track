# Good Practices for Software Development
### **Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**

- The idea of **joining meetings 5-10 minutes early** to build rapport and casually connect with teammates.
- Using **Loom** (or other screencast tools) to explain problems visually.
- The advice to **over-communicate in team channels** rather than private DMs so that more eyes are on the message.
- **Time tracking apps** like **Boosted** and tools like **Freedom** or **TimeLimit** to block distractions during work hours.
- The importance of being **mindful of food and physical activity** for better focus and productivity.

### **Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

####  Area to Improve: Asking for Help Effectively

I tend to ask vague questions when stuck, like "itâ€™s not working" or "need help," which may confuse the person helping me.

####  Ideas to Make Progress:

- Start writing **clear, detailed problem descriptions** including:
  - What I was trying to do
  - What went wrong
  - Screenshots or error messages
  - What I tried already
- Start using tools like:
  - **Loom** for screencasts
  - **GitHub Gists** for sharing code
  - **CodeSandbox** or **CodePen** for live code
- Observe how issues are reported in **open-source GitHub repositories** and apply similar structure
